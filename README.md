# Object-Detection

## Summary:

Implement an object detectior deep learning algorithm which can detect roofs and trees on a custom dataset.
This cutom dataset by annotating images from Sensfly Crop Field (RGB) dataset
The following are step undertaken:- 
- Create a cutom dataset by annotating images 
- Train object on the dataset
- Predict and validate results
